# Ham IPB (International Beacon Project) Monitor

**Ham IPB (International Beacon Project) Monitor, written in Python.**

This project was started as there are such monitors, but no source code available, and Faros could not program my
Yeasu FTdx10 properly (it went to transmit mode immediately)

# Beacon transmission schedule

- The beacons are transmitted on the frequencies 14.100 MHz, 18.110 MHz, 21.150 MHz, 24.930 MHz and 28.200 MHz. 
- Each beacon transmission site operates around the clock. 
- Beacon is transmitted once on each frequency, from low (14.100 MHz) to high (28.200 MHz), followed by a 130-second pause after which the cycle is repeated.
- Each transmission is 10 second long, and consists of the call sign of the beacon transmitted at 22 words per minute (WPM) followed by four dashes. 
- The call sign and the first dash is transmitted at 100 watts of power. Subsequent three dashes are transmitted at 10 watts, 1 watt and 0.1 watt respectively.
- All beacon transmissions are coordinated using GPS time. As such, at a given frequency, all 18 beacons are transmitted once every three minutes.

## ham-ipb-monitor Features

- Shows which beacon is currently transmitting on which frequency.
- By means of a CAT interface, will tune the receiver to one of the beacon frequencies.
- First text only output will be written, followed by a GUI using PySide6.
- Strategies: 
  - Follow a specific beacon over all possible frequencies, or 
  - Stay on one frequency to monitor all possible beacons

## Requirements

- Virtual COM port driver from https://www.yaesu.com/product-detail.aspx?Model=FTDX10&CatName=HF%20Transceivers/Amplifiers

After the installation and connection to the tranceiver, you should see 2 ports in the Windows device manager.

- `Silicon Labs Dual CP210x USB to UART Bridge: Enhanced COM Port (COMxx)`
  - The **Enhanced COM Port** is for CAT Communications (Frequency and Comminication Mode Settings)
- `Silicon Labs Dual CP210x USB to UART Bridge: Standard COM Port (COMxx)`
  - The **Standard COM Port** is for TX Controls (PTT Control, CW Keying, Digital Mode Operation)
